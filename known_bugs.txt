[0.1]
b0.1.1 - After restarting my PC, the task list was empty
b0.1.2 - [FIXED (0.2)] Sometimes the wrong index is picked, deleting the wrong task (work on solidifying the line height)
b0.1.3 - Occasionally, after refreshing the list, an extra blank line is inserted (most often observed when refreshing immediately after adding a task)
